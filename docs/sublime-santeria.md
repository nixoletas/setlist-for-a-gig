title: Sublime - Santeria
---


I don't practice Santeria
I ain't got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars
But I, I'd spend it all
If I could find that Heina
And that Sancho that she's found
Well, I'd pop a cap in Sancho
And I'd slap her down

What I really wanna know
Ah, baby, mhmm
What I really wanna say
I can't define
Well, it's love
That I need, oh
My soul will have to

Wait till I get back
To find a Heina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break
Feel the break, feel the break
And I got live it up
Oh, yeah, huh
Well, I swear that I

What I really wanna know
Ah, baby
What I really wanna say
I can't define
Got love, make it go
My soul will have to
What I really wanna say
Ah, baby
What I really wanna say
Is I've got mine
And I'll make it
Oh, yes I'm coming up
Tell Sanchito that if

He knows what is good for him
He best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new Forty-Five
And I won't think twice to stick
That barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I got
Somethin' for his punk ass

What I really wanna know
Ah, baby
Ooh, what I really wanna say
Is there's just one
Way back, and I'll make it, yeah
My soul will have to wait
Yeah, yeah, yeah
