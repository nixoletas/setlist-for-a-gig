# Docusaurus of songs i can play

Made using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

I'm sick and tired of chords and tabs websites, decided to use the amazing Docusaurus to build my own.

### Install

```
npm install
```

### Local dev

```
npm run start
```

Searchbar repo: [https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local)

For the searchbar to work, you need to build & serve

### Build

```
npm run build
```

Serve
```
npm run serve
```

### How to use

I recommend reading the official Docusaurus documentation! but basically you can create ".md" files inside pages, or blogs, or docs, and routes will be automatically created for that Markdown! That's awesome! ‚≠ê
